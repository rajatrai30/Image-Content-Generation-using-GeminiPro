# This is a project that uses the Gemini Pro API to create a model that can be used to predict the price of a gemstone based on its features. The model is trained using a dataset of gemstones and their prices. The model is then deployed as a web application using Flask. The web application allows users to input the features of a gemstone and get a price prediction./*!/*!
